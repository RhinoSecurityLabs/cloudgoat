        In this scenario, you'll simulate the core elements of a major TELCO breach from 2021. You'll 
        start with access to a low-privileged user and need to enumerate AWS infrastructure, identify 
        network segmentation flaws in VPC peering and security groups, escalate privileges via EC2 meta-data access, and 
        move laterally to access sensitive data from a MySQL RDS instance.
