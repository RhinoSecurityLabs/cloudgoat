        Starting as the IAM user Lara, the attacker explores a Load Balancer and S3 bucket for
        clues to vulnerabilities, leading to an RCE exploit on a vulnerable web app which exposes
        confidential files and culminates in access to the scenarioâ€™s goal: a highly-secured RDS
        database instance.
        Alternatively, the attacker may start as the IAM user McDuck and enumerate S3 buckets,
        eventually leading to SSH keys which grant direct access to the EC2 server and the database
        beyond.
