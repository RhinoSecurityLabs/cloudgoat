dateutils
=========

The main purpose of this package is to provide more complex arithmetic
operations on dates/times. Heavy use is made of the relativedelta type from
Labix's dateutil library. Much of this package is just a light wrapper on top
of this with some added features such as range generation and business day
calculation.

Installation
------------

You should install dateutils with pip:

    pip install dateutils

Otherwise, you'll have to download the package and run:

    python setup.py install

If you install it this way then you will also have to install all necessary
dependencies manually.
