        This Scenario demonstrates more nuanced IAM privilege escalation techniques. 
        It is partially intended to be a demonstration of how to use the IAMActionHunter tool.
        Goal: Starting as the cg_dev_user find a way to compromise the cg_admin_ec2 and gain the privileges
        of the cg_ec2_admin_role.
