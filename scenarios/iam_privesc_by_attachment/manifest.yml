        Starting with a very limited set of permissions, the attacker is able to leverage the
        instance-profile-attachment permissions to create a new EC2 instance with significantly
        greater privileges than their own. With access to this new EC2 instance, the attacker gains
        full administrative powers within the target account and is able to accomplish the
        scenario's goal - deleting the cg-super-critical-security-server and paving the way for
        further nefarious actions.

        Note: This scenario may require you to create some AWS resources, and because CloudGoat can
        only manage resources it creates, you should remove them manually before running `cloudgoat
        destroy`.
