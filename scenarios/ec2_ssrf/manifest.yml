        Starting as the IAM user Solus, the attacker discovers they have ReadOnly permissions to a
        Lambda function, where hardcoded secrets lead them to an EC2 instance running a web
        application that is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). After exploiting the
        vulnerable app and acquiring keys from the EC2 metadata service, the attacker gains access
        to a private S3 bucket with a set of keys that allow them to invoke the Lambda function and
        complete the scenario.
