        In this scenario, you are provided with AWS credentials. You need to enumerate permissions and discover you can list and subscribe to SNS topics. You then use Pacu's new modules "sns__enum" and "sns__subscribe" to subscribe to the topic. You will receive an email from the topic with an API Key as a debug message. Then, use the AWS CLI to enumerate the API Gateways to find the API Gateway path, method, stage, and resource. Finally, do a curl request with the API key to get the final flag.
